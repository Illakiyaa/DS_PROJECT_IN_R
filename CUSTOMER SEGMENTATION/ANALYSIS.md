Customer Segmentation is one the most important applications of unsupervised learning. 
Using clustering techniques, companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base. 
In this machine learning project, we will make use of k-mean Clustering which is the essential algorithm for clustering unlabelled dataset.


In this data science project, we went through the customer segmentation model. 
We developed this using a class of machine learning known as unsupervised learning. 
Specifically, we made use of a clustering algorithm called K-means clustering.
We analysed and visualized the data and then proceeded to implement our algorithm. 
Hope you enjoyed this customer segmentation project of machine learning using R
